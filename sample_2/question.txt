Sample Question 2
-----------------
A palindrome is a word, number, or other sequence of characters which reads
the same backward as forward, such as madam or mom.
Given a list of words, one on each line, output “Yes” if the word is a palindrome
and “No” if it isn’t a palindrome.

INPUT:
● Each line contains a sequence of characters which may or may not be a palindrome.

OUTPUT:
● Print a line that contains either “Yes” if the word is a palindrome or “No” 
if it isn’t a palindrome.

EXAMPLE:

Input:
hannah
669966
evidence
$$$$£

Output:
Yes
Yes
No
No

EXPLANATION:
● For the first input the word is “hannah” which is the reads the same backwards as 
it does forward. So “Yes” is printed to the console.
● For the sequence of characters “$$$$£” in the last input, the first letter and 
the last character are not the same so we can be sure the answer is “No”.
